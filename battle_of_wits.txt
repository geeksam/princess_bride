[Scene: Open area. Vizzini is seated behind a covered table.
Buttercup, blindfolded, is sitting to his left. On the table is a
bottle of wine and two goblets. Roberts approaches the Table]

Vizzini:    So it is down to you, and it is down to me. If you
            wish her dead, by all means, keep moving forward.

Dread Pirate Roberts:

            Let me explain--

Vizzini:    There's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap
            what I have rightfully stolen.

Dread Pirate Roberts:

            Perhaps an arrangement can be reached?

Vizzini:    There will be no arrangement, and you're killing her.

Dread Pirate Roberts:

            Well if there can be no arrangement, then we are at
            an impasse.

Vizzini:    I'm afraid so. I can't compete with you physically,
            and you're no match for my brains.

Dread Pirate Roberts:

            You're that smart?

Vizzini:    Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato,
            Aristotle, Socrates?

Dread Pirate Roberts:

            Yes.

Vizzini:    Morons.

Dread Pirate Roberts:

            Really. [pause] In that case, I challenge you to a
            battle of wits.

Vizzini:    For the princess? < Pirate nods > To the death? <
            Pirate nods > I accept.

Dread Pirate Roberts:

            Good. Then pour the wine.

            [Roberts pulls out a small vial, and uncorks it]

            Inhale this, but do not touch.

Vizzini:    I smell nothing.

Dread Pirate Roberts:

            What you do not smell is called Iocane powder. It is
            odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid,
            and is among the more deadly poisons known to man.

Vizzini:    Hmmmm.

Dread Pirate Roberts: < turns away from Vizzini with the goblets,
            and pours the poison in. Goblets replaced on the
            table, one in front of each. >

            All right. Where is the poison? The battle of wits
            has begun. It ends when you decide and we both
            drink, and find out who is right...and who is dead.
